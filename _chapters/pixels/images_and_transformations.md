# Images and Transformations #

## Image Types ##
In computer vision, the three most common types of images are:
1. binary
2. grayscale
3. color

### Binary image representation ###
A binary image is stored as a 2D matrix of binary values. Each element is considered a pixel, and each pixel can only take two values: 0 (black) or 1 (white).
